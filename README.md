# pysnippets

...is a **non-representative** collection of short Python snippets that exemplify

- basic features such as builtin functions
- frequently used packages from the standard library
- magic aka dunder methods
- some syntactic sugar such as decorators, ternaries and comprehensions

---

### Audience

- You are new to Python but familiar with OOP - you don't want to skim through pages explaining what classes and
  instances are
  <br/>*("think of a monkey as an instance of the mammal class which is a subclass of the animal class blah blah
  blah...")*<br/>
  if a **three-liner** might state everything you need to know.
- You are familiar with Python, but you forgot a detail e.g. how list slicing works, and you don't want to be told what
  a list is and why you would slice it.
- You prefer self-explanatory code snippets over verbose tutorials.

### Limitations

This code collection is not meant to be a tutorial nor should you consider it to be representative - <br/>
Python has a vast amount of cool features and packages and this collection only scratches the surface.
